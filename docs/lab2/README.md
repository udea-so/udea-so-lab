# Testing

## Why Testing

- Tests allow us to find flaws in our software
- Good tests document the code by describing the intent
- Automated tests saves time, compared to manual tests
- Automated tests allow us to safely change and refactor our code without introducing regressions

## The Fundamentals

- We consider code to be incomplete if it is not accompanied by tests
- We write unit tests (tests without external dependencies) that can run before every PR merge to validate that we donâ€™t have regressions
- We write Integration tests/E2E tests that test the whole system end to end, and run them regularly
- We write our tests early and block any further code merging if tests fail.
- We run load tests/performance tests where appropriate to validate that the system performs under stress

## Build for Testing

Testing is a critical part of the development process.  It is important to build your application with testing in mind.  Here are some tips to help you build for testing:

- **Parameterize everything.** Rather than hard-code any variables, consider making everything a configurable parameter with a reasonable default. This will allow you to easily change the behavior of your application during testing. Particularly during performance testing, it is common to test different values to see what impact that has on performance. If a range of defaults need to change together, consider one or more parameters which set "modes", changing the defaults of a group of parameters together.

- **Document at startup.** When your application starts up, it should log all parameters. This ensures the person reviewing the logs and application behavior know exactly how the application is configured.

- **Log to console.** Logging to external systems like Azure Monitor is desirable for traceability across services. This requires logs to be dispatched from the local system to the external system and that is a dependency that can fail. It is important that someone be able to console logs directly on the local system.

- **Log to external system.** In addition to console logs, logging to an external system like Azure Monitor is desirable for traceability across services and durability of logs.

- **Log all activity.** If the system is performing some activity (reading data from a database, calling an external service, etc.), it should log that activity. Ideally, there should be a log message saying the activity is starting and another log message saying the activity is complete. This allows someone reviewing the logs to understand what the application is doing and how long it is taking. Depending on how noisy this is, different messages can be associated with different log levels, but it is important to have the information available when it comes to debugging a deployed system.
